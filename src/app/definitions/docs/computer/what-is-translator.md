A translator is a tool or program that converts high-level programming language into machine language. For humans, it is easier to read and write high-level programming language (like C++, java, and javascript) and then the translator helps to convert our code to binary instruction which are easily understood by the computer.

## Types of Translators:

There are two kinds of translators which are known as Interpreter and
Compilers.

### Interpreter

An [interpreter](/definitions/what-is-interpreter/)

### Compiler

A [compiler](/definitions/what-is-compiler/)

### Assembler

An [assembler](/definitions/what-is-assembler/)

## Why Translators Are Important.

- <strong>Portability</strong>: Translators enable code written in one programming language to be executed on different hardware platforms and operating systems. This portability is essential for software developers who want their programs to run on a wide range of devices without modification.
